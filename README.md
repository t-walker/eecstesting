# EECS Computer Science Placement test
## Why?
At WSU, we have two classes that entry level Computer Science students can take: Python or C Programming.
Students are sorted primarily based on whether or not they've taken a computer science class before and a math score.
However, this method is highly inaccurate.

## How?
Wanting to make sure that students are properly sorted into the correct, the department
has decided to create a test that will give advisors a recommendation based on their score and other key performance indicators.
This web application not only allows students to take the test but also will allow administrators to add additional information and
analyze this data on the back-end.
